# VicBioCon17 README

Welcome to your README for the GitHub repository containing your work from the Victorian Biodiversity Conference R Workshop. The README is the landing place for your repository on GitHub and is the first thing others will see when they arrive here.

A README can take on various forms, depending on the nature of your project, project maturity, and the number of collaborators or users you expect to visit your repository. README files are useful for communicating:

- What the aim of the project is
- why the project is useful
- how any users or contributors of the code in your repository can get started
- who to contact for assistance
- the structure of the the project directory and protocol for collaborating

A README should always go into the root directory of your repository. GitHub looks for this file and can automatically render this file to visitors.

## 'Rendering' README files

By saving your README file with the extension `.md`, your file is saved as a markdown file. When you created this repository in GitHub and selected the option to create a README file, GitHub automatically created the file as a markdown document: `README.md`. The code you pasted from the version control document here is written in Markdown. Markdown is a an easy to use syntax for creating stylised text on the web. When your markdown text is converted from markdown to html, this is called "rendering".

## Why share your project publically on GitHub?

Open Science, duh. Sharing your code and / or data publically on GitHub allows anybody to view your work, facilitating longitudinal studies, meta-analyses, or simply making a new and novel method you've been working on available for others to implement. 

Sharing your reserach data as well as your code may even boost your paper's citation stats (Piwowar et al, 2007).

A README is quintessential to having a well-documented and reproducible open repository. In addition to keeping good meta-data, sharing your work openly may facilitate new problem formulations and new frameworks in your discipline (Freire et al, 2012).
